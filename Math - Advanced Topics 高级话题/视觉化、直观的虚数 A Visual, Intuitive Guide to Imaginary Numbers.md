##  A Visual, Intuitive Guide to Imaginary Number
- **Focusing on relationships, not mechanical formulas**. //关注**关系**
- **Seeing complex numbers as an upgrade to our number system**, just like 0，decimals and negatives //把复数看作**数系统的升级**
- **Using visual diagrams**, to understand the idea rather text /**/视觉化！**
##### Learning by analogy. imaginary numbers' ancestor, the negatives

|Fun Fact🤔事实 |Negative Numbers(-x) 负数   |Complex Numbers(a+bi) 复数  |
|--------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
|Invented to answer|"what is 3-4?"|"What is sqrt(-1)"                   |
|Strange because.. |_How can you have less than nothing?_|_How can you take the square root of less than nothing?_|
|Intuitive meaning |"_Opposite_"|"_Rotation_"|

## Really Understanding Negative Numbers //负数 

#### euler, who discovered e
### Enter Imaginary Numbers //虚数
#### the answer of the equation: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31954987/198940457-2bf40d51-1d67-45cb-99b5-3593878c887f.png)are 3 and -3
#### so-called "imaginary numbers" are as normal as every other number: they're a tool to describe the world.In the same spirit of assuming -1, .3 and 0"exist"//描述世界的工具🔧

### 3. Why Complex Multiplication Works? 复数的乘法

#### rotate twice in other direction(clockwise) to turn 1 into -1. This is "negative" rotation or a multiplication by -i:

#### if we multiply by -i twice, the first multiplication would turn 1 into -i, and the second turn -i into -1. there two square roots of -1: i and -i
- i is a "new imaginary dimension" to measure a number //虚数：想象的维度 用以衡量数字
- i(or -i) is what numbers "become" when rotated //实数旋转变虚数
- Multiplying i is a rotation by 90 degrees counter-clockwise //✖️ i逆时针旋转90度
- Multiplying by -i is a rotation of 90 degrees clockwise //✖️ -i顺时针旋转90度
- Two rotations in either direction is -1: it brings us back into the “regular” dimensions of positive and negative numbers. //两个不同方向的旋转是-1：

### **Numbers are 2-dimensional** //数是二维的
#### it is mind bending, just like **decimals and long** division would be mind-bending to an ancient Roman(_What do you mean there's a number between 1 and 2?_) 
#### https://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-intuitive-guide-to-imaginary-numbers/

#### 🌟🌟🌟 also, keep in mind that having counter-clockwise be positive is a human convention - it easily could have been the other way //逆时针为正是人为
