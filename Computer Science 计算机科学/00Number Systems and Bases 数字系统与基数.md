### Number Systems and Bases //数字系统与基数
#### Base systems like binary and hexadecimal, Hex and binary, tick over every 16 and 2 items //二进制与十六进制数字系统，
#### Try converting numbers to hex and binary [here](https://instacalc.com/1439):
### Way back when :Unary Numbers //一元数
#### When you wanted to count one
- 1
#### When you wanted 5
- 11111

#### and clearly, 1 + 5 = 6
- 1 + 11111 = 111111

### Enter the Romans //进入罗马记数
```
one = I
two = II
three = III
```

#### What could do better than the old tradition of lines. For five, use V to represent IIIII
- I + V = VI
- Symbols I, V, X, L, C, D and M standing respectively for 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1,000
- The key point is that V and IIIII are two ways of encoding the number 5.

### Give each number a name //给每个数字一个名字
#### **each number** can be its own distinct concept
#### here is how we get the symbols：
- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

### Use the position //使用位置
#### notice one insight about Roman numerals: they use **position** of symbols to indicate meaning.
- IV means "subtract 1 from 5"
- and VI means "add 1 to 5"
#### in our number system, we **always add** and never subtract, 35 means "add 3*10"
