### Way back when :Unary Numbers //一元数
#### When you wanted to count one
- 1
#### When you wanted 5
- 11111

#### and clearly, 1 + 5 = 6
- 1 + 11111 = 111111

### Enter the Romans //进入罗马记数
```
one = I
two = II
three = III
```

#### What could do better than the old tradition of lines. For five, use V to represent IIIII
- I + V = VI
- Symbols I, V, X, L, C, D and M standing respectively for 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1,000
- The key point is that V and IIIII are two ways of encoding the number 5.
