**arithmetic**算术 is the area of mathematics that studies numbers and the[[Arithmetic operation|operations]] performed with them.

**Identity numbers** are those that do not affect the operation sum and product respectively. the identity number of sum is zero, and that of the product is 1.不影响 sum运算 和product运算. sum运算的 identity number 为0. product 为1

the opposite numbers are those equidistant from 0. in practice, they are the positive and negative versions of the same number.是相同数字的 正数与 负数表达形式 for example, the opposite of 1 is -1. therefore, zero is the only number that is its own opposite, and is therefore neither positive nor negative. 

the absolute value of a number is its value regardless of its sign. it is represented by the notation between slashes. For example `|-2|==2` 

a **prime number** is a number greater than 1 that is divisible only by itself and 1,素数是大于1只能被自己和1整除的数 i.e. it has no multiples.它没有倍数 On the other hand, a compound number is any number that is not prime; that is, it has more multiples 复合数是任何非素数的数，它有更多的倍数

two integers are said to be **dividable** if the remainder of their quotation is zero 如果两个整数 相除的余数为0，则称为可分的

A **factorization** is the decomposition of a number into its prime factors, i.e. the prime numbers that, when multiplied together, give that number. For example, 45 has 5, 3 and 3 as factors(because 5 * 9 = 45) 因式分解是将一个数字分解为它的质因数，即质数相乘后得到该数字。例如，45有5、3和3作为因子

the lowest number divisible by the two numbers is called the least **common multiple** 能被两个数字整除的最低数字称为最小公倍数 the least common multiple number between 4 and 6 is 12. It can be determined by multiplying the factors of both numbers(without repeating them between number)通过两个数字的系数相乘来确定 `4 = 2 * 2` and `6 = 2 * 3`, so the least common multiple is calculated as `2 * 2 * 3 = 12` 
for adding and subtracting fractions from each other. 用于分数之间的互相加减

the greatest common factor between two numbers is called the maximum common divisor. 最大公因数称为最大公除数 12 和 18 的最大公除数是 6 for example, the greatest common divisor of 12 and 18 is 6. it can be determined by finding the greatest common factors. for example,` 12 = 2 * 2 * 3 ` and ` 18 = 2 * 3 * 3 ` both numbers have the factor` 2 * 3 ` so their greatest common factor is 6. 

a number that results from inverting the numberator分子 and denominator分母 of a fraction is called a reciprocal number or inverse multiplicative number. in the case of numbers that are not fractions, the denominator is 1. For example, the reciprocal of 3 (or 3/1) is 1/3. the product of a number and its reciprocal is always 1. 由分数的分子和分母反转而产生的数字称为 倒数 或者 逆乘法数。 例如 3 （或3/1）的倒数是 1/3. 数的乘积与其倒数始终为 1.
