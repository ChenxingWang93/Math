**arithmetic**算术 is the area of mathematics that studies numbers and the[[Arithmetic operation|operations]] performed with them.

**Identity numbers** are those that do not affect the operation sum and product respectively. the identity number of sum is zero, and that of the product is 1.不影响 sum运算 和product运算. sum运算的 identity number 为0. product 为1

the opposite numbers are those equidistant from 0. in practice, they are the positive and negative versions of the same number.是相同数字的 正数与 负数表达形式 for example, the opposite of 1 is -1. therefore, zero is the only number that is its own opposite, and is therefore neither positive nor negative. 

the absolute value of a number is its value regardless of its sign. it is represented by the notation between slashes. For example `|-2|==2` 

a **prime number** is a number greater than 1 that is divisible only by itself and 1,素数是大于1只能被自己和1整除的数 i.e. it has no multiples.它没有倍数 On the other hand, a compound number is any number that is not prime; that is, it has more multiples 复合数是任何非素数的数，它有更多的倍数
