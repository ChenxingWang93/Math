***Algebra*** is the branch of mathematics that studies the combination of elements according to certain rules. It seeks to find the value of ***variables*** or ***unknowns***. 包含领域有多项式Polynomials, 等式Equations, 函数Functions.

**Evaluating** means giving values to all or some of the variables in an expression 评估意味着 把值给到 表达式中的 所有或者一些变量 

the combination of real numbers(constants)实数 and literal numbers(variable)变量 by means of operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, potentiation is called an **algebraic expression** 加，减，乘，增强

**algebraic term** is the sum of an algebraic expression.代数表达式的和 an algebraic term 代数term包含3部分 usually has 3 parts:
- **coefficient**系数: real number that multiplies the variable. 与变量相乘的 实数
- **base**基础: the variable 变量                                                              
- **exponent**指数: the degree of the variable. 变量的级数

two algebraic terms are said to be similar when they have the same base and the same exponent 两个代数项如果相似那就是有相同的基础base 和指数

an algebraic term that has no variable is called an independent term 没有变量的代数称之为 **independent term**
