3D math is all about measuring locations, distances and angles in a 3D space, and this is usually done in a **cartesian coordinate system**.

A 2D cartesian coordinate system is a space defined by 2 orthogonal axis $(x,y)$ where:

- the intersection of axis is called **origin**. 轴的交点称为原点

- any point of that space can be expressed as two numbers called **coordinates**. A coordinate is the distance of the axis projection of that point to the **origin** 空间中任意两点 能被表示为两个数字 的**坐标**，**坐标**是该点轴投影到原点的距离

- the arrangement of axis doesn't matter(e.g. we could make $y$ look left). Any arrangement is reachable from the rest of arrangements thru rotation in the $x$, $y$, & $z$ axis, which means that we are always in the same coordinate system.
