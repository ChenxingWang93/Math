### A Calculus Analogy: Integrals as Multiplication  //Integrals: 积分；Multiplication：乘法；
#### Integral are often described as finding the area under a curve. this description is too narrow, 积分作为找到函数曲线下面积的理解还是太狭隘了
#### it's like saying multiplication exists to find the area of rectangles. 这就好像在说乘法的存在在于找到矩形的面积
#### finding the area is a useful _application_, but not the _purpose_ of multiplication.
#### key insight: integrals help us combine numbers when multiplication can't //积分的目的在于结合乘法所不能结合的变化数
#### aha moment: integration is a "better multiplication" that works on things that change 积分是用来描述变化的 “更好的乘法” -- area is just _one way_ to visualize multiplication, the key **isn't the area**, it's the idea of combining quantities into a new result. //结合变化进而得到一个新结果

### Understanding Multiplication 我们对乘法的理解随着时间的推移而改变
