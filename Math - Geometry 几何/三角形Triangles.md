## **Triangle Meshes** 三角网格
a triangle is defined by three vertices and it's contained in a [[Planes#Plane for more points|plane that we can infere from its vertices]]) the order of those vertices matter because because it usually determines the front and the back side of the triangle. vertices的顺序很关键，因为它通常定义了三角面的前后 In a [[Cartesian space|left-handed system]]在左手定则的笛卡尔空间中
