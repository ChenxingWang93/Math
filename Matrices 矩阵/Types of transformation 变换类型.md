we think of the determinant of a matrix as the signed scale factor representing how much a matrix transforms the volume of an n-cube into an m-dimensional parallelepiped, 矩阵的行列式作为有符号的比例因子，代表一个矩阵变换n-cube的体积 到 m-维 平行六面体

it is straightforward to see why a matrix with a determinant of 0 is singular很直观地看到一个行列式为0的矩阵是单数，because the matrix is collapsing space along at least one direction因为矩阵是至少延着一维折叠空间

lay the ground work for understanding matrices as geometric objects, 理解矩阵作为几何物体 focus on matrices because they affect how i think of vectors, vector spaces, the determinant, null space, spans, ranks, inverse matrices, singular value, and so on 影响我如何看待向量，向量空间，行列式，空空间，跨，行列，逆矩阵，奇异值
