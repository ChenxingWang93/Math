#### Rethinking Arithmetic: A Visual Guide
Arithmetic gives us tools to **smoosh, slide, and stretch** numbers. sometimes there's things in the real world we want to **smoosh, slide, and stretch** in the same way //平滑、滑动、拉伸
#### Seeing Arithmetic as a ****type of transformation**** to make sense of seemingly-wired concepts, like the square root of -1, and visualize the problem in a new way.

## Addition 加法
- Accumulate: Count up similar quantities (often for tangible items).
- Slide: Shifting a number along a scale (for less tangible things, like temperature). //℃
- Combine: Make a new quantity out of two different ones (like notes in a music chord). //🎵
